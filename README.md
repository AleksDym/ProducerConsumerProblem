# ProducerConsumerProblem

This code is a solution to the producer-consumer multi-process synchronization problem. 
In order to protect the critical section and aviod deadlocks the Monitor is used.

Monitor = a synchronization construct that allows threads to have both 
mutual exclusion and the ability to wait (block) for a certain condition to become false
